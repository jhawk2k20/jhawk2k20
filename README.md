- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhawk2k20
- 👀 I’m interested in Building very fast computers, and using and or creating innovative ways to cool hot hardware so it runs its best! I don't really even game, I just benchmark honestly and fairly, but thats not just what im interested in, its also my job; building all levels of PC's and servers, workstations, etc. I am also interested in virtualization, containerization, and AI, lots of deep learning but mostly self-hosted. I use Windows when needed or for clients but otherwise I live in Linux, having a first-level consumer grade PC from IBM in the early 80s I was fluent with DOS commands a few months after I learned to spell in school.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of deep learning on a self-hosted level, and also a lot of docker and other types of container platforms, heavy into Proxmox, Truenas Scale, etc.
- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I am interested in or even if I am not very interested in but can help others I am down. Optimally I would like to collaborate where my previous/current knowledge on a few areas mostly deep learning and ways to self host them at home and no I do not have the worlds fastest or most impressive homelab, but what I do have definetely works and is not the weakest either, but its not a compitition.
- 📫 How to reach me gmail being jhawk2k25@gmail.com which I have created fairly recently and is free of spam and junk (for now. lol) or my github email address being jhawk2k20@gmail.com which I still actively watch as well.
